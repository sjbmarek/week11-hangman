# week11-hangman

The hangman project revisits the earlier hangman work - this time we use the command window and more advanced javascript programming methods.


This application features:
  inquirer, 
  two constructors in separate files, 
  recursion rather than for loop.
  
  
I have not added a recursive element to reinitiate the game yet.
